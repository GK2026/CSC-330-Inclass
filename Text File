Q1: Why didnâ€™t we use sudo before node lab.js in this case?: 
Q2: What does lab.js do?: When we run lab.js what appears in the contents of the plain text file. 
Q3: Why does *************after readFile*****************
appear before the contents of plain.txt in the output while the call to readFile is before
the console.log call that prints this line.
